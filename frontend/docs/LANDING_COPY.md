# SkillForge Landing Page Copy

==============================
SECTION 1 — HERO (Above the Fold)
==============================

**Headline**
Stop proving you learned. Start proving you can do.

**Subheadline**
SkillForge validates your real programming skills through hands-on tasks—so employers see evidence, not just certificates.

**Primary CTA**
Start Your Placement

**Secondary CTA**
See how it works

**Reassurance Line**
Takes 20 minutes. No prep needed. No tricks.

==============================
SECTION 2 — THE PROBLEM (Reality Check)
==============================

**Problem Statements**
1. You finished courses, collected certificates, and still get ignored.
2. Employers don't trust what they can't verify.
3. Your portfolio sits there, but nobody knows if you actually built it.

**Transition Line**
SkillForge changes the question from "What did you learn?" to "What can you build?"

==============================
SECTION 3 — HOW SKILLFORGE WORKS (3 Steps)
==============================

**Step 1: Placement**
Title: Find your level
Explanation: Answer a short set of real coding tasks so we understand where you actually are—not where a course says you should be.

**Step 2: Build proof through tasks/projects**
Title: Build real evidence
Explanation: Complete focused challenges that match your level, each one reviewed and scored based on working code.

**Step 3: Show evidence others can trust**
Title: Share what you proved
Explanation: Your profile shows verified skills with scores and project work—evidence employers can trust because they didn't take your word for it.

==============================
SECTION 4 — WHO THIS IS FOR
==============================

**Students**
Pain: You've learned a lot but have no credible way to prove it.
Benefit: Get a verified skill profile that speaks louder than a certificate wall.

**Employers**
Pain: Resumes don't tell you who can actually ship code.
Benefit: See candidates ranked by demonstrated ability, not self-reported keywords.

**Educators / Admins**
Pain: You can't track which students are truly job-ready.
Benefit: Monitor real progress and identify who needs support before it's too late.

==============================
SECTION 5 — THE COMMITMENT MOMENT (Final CTA)
==============================

**Heading**
Ready to know where you stand?

**Reinforcement Line**
No more guessing. No more hoping your resume lands. Take the placement and see your real level in 20 minutes.

**Primary CTA**
Start Your Placement

**Reassurance Line**
Free to start. No credit card. No spam.

==============================
SECTION 6 — MICROCOPY & EDGE CASES
==============================

**Placement Reassurance Text**
This isn't a test you pass or fail. It's a starting point. Answer what you can, skip what you can't—we just need to see where you are right now.

**First-Time User Reassurance**
You're in the right place. Most people here felt the same gap between what they know and what they can prove. Let's close it.

**Empty-State Motivational Copy**
Nothing here yet. That's fine—everyone starts somewhere. Pick your first task and begin building proof.

**Error-State Calming Copy**
Something went wrong on our end. Your progress is safe. Refresh and try again, or come back in a minute.
